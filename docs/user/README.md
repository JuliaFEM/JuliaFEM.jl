# JuliaFEM User Manual

**Audience:** End users, engineers, students who want to run simulations and get results.

This manual is designed to be **simple and practical** - get you from zero to running simulations as quickly as possible.

## What's Here

- **Quick Start:** Installation and first simulation in 5 minutes
- **Tutorials:** Step-by-step guides for common problems
- **Examples:** Pre-built simulations you can run and modify
- **API Reference:** Function documentation (what does this do?)
- **Troubleshooting:** Common errors and how to fix them

## What's NOT Here

- Deep theory (see `docs/book/` for that)
- How to contribute code (see `docs/contributor/` for that)
- Internal architecture details

## Philosophy

**"Just show me how to solve my problem."**

We assume you:
- Have a problem to solve (heat transfer, elasticity, contact)
- Want working code, not lectures
- Will read theory when YOU need it, not when WE think you should

## Getting Help

1. Start with the Quick Start
2. Find an example similar to your problem
3. Modify it to fit your needs
4. If stuck, check Troubleshooting
5. Still stuck? Ask on GitHub Discussions
